To use this program, simply run the executable and it should create a brand new zipped texture pack for you, you just need to actually transfer it to minecraft.
This does not randomize everything. It randomizes them based on subsection (like blocks, mobs, gui).
It also does not randomize banners, pottery, or extra texture on shields, as they took up far too many texture spots and make the texture packs far less fun to use.
